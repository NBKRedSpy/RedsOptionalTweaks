Unfortunately Steam has a limit of how much text can be put in a mod's description.

[h2]Maximum Compatibility[/h2]

Each modification works like its own mini-mod. Disable one, and it's as if it was never there.  This is useful for working around bugs or handling conflicts with other mods.
See the Compatibility - Technical section for details.
