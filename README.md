For details on each tweak, see each tweak's sections below.  


# Tweaks
## Mouse Quick Toss Rebind
Allows the user to bind the "quick toss" key.  This is the game's functionality where the user can hover over an item and hold the control key to move the item to the other inventory.  
The user can change the control key.  By default it the key bound to the middle mouse button (AKA Mouse2).

## Ship Speed Boost
Changes the ship's speed to decrease travel times.  By default, this sets the ship to 2x the speed.

## Split Stacks Hotkeys
When an item is being split, the dialog is shown.  This tweak adds the following:

Adds increase and decrease hotkeys to change the value by one.  By default it is A and D. 

Adds up to five preset amounts.  For example, the user can press 1, and the dialog will change the "keep" amount (the number on the right) to 10.
By default, 1 is set to 10, and 2 is set to 5.


# Compatibility - Technical
For modders, here are the technical details.
Each mod is isolated and has a Harmony Prepare patch for all affected patches.  Non Harmony patches are gated by the same  enable flag.
This allows mods to be completely disabled.

# Configuration
The configuration can be changed with either the Mod Configuration Menu's "Mods" button on the main menu, or directly in the config file.  The "Mods" button is the preferred route.

The config file is found at is found at `%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\RedsOptionalTweaks\config.json` and will be created the first time the game is run.  Changes will be applied when the game is restarted.

For any key binding items, see the [Key List](#key-list) section below.

## Key List
The list of valid keyboard keys can be found  at the bottom of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
Beware that numbers 0-9 are Alpha0 - Alpha9.  Most of the other keys are as expected such as X for X.
Use "None" to not bind the key.
