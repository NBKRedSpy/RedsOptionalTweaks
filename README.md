Each tweak can be configured in the Mods button on the main menu, under the "Red's Optional Tweaks" section.  
For details on each tweak, see the related section below.

## Maximum Compatibility
Each tweak works like its own mini-mod. Disable one, and it's as if it was never there.  This is useful for working around bugs or handling conflicts with other mods.

See the [Compatibility - Technical](#compatibility---technical) section for details.

# Tweaks
## Mouse Quick Toss Rebind
Allows the user to bind the "quick toss" key.  This is where the user can hold the ctrl key down while the mouse is over an item to move the item to the other inventory.
By default it is remapped to middle mouse button (AKA Mouse2).

## Ship Speed Boost
Changes the ship's speed to decrease travel times.  By default this sets the ship to 2x the speed.

## Split Stacks Hotkeys
When a stack of items is being split, the split dialog is shown.  This tweak adds the following:

Adds increase and decrease hotkeys to change the value by one.  By default it is A and D. 

Adds up to five preset amounts.  For example, the user can press 1 and the dialog will change the "keep" amount (the number on the right) to 10.
By default, 1 is set to 10, and 2 is set to 5.


# Compatibility - Technical
For modders, here are the technical details.

Each tweak contains their own patches and uses the enabled flag in the Harmony Prepare function to enable the tweak.  Non Harmony patches are gated by the same  enable flag.

# Configuration
The configuration can be changed with either the Mod Configuration Menu's "Mods" button on the main menu, or directly in the config file.  The "Mods" button is the preferred route.

The config file is found at is found at `%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\RedsOptionalTweaks\config.json` and will be created the first time the game is run.  Changes will be applied when the game is restarted.

For any key binding items, see the [Key List](#key-list) section below.

## Key List
The list of valid keyboard keys can be found  at the bottom of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
Beware that numbers 0-9 are Alpha0 - Alpha9.  Most of the other keys are as expected such as X for X.
Use "None" to not bind the key.
